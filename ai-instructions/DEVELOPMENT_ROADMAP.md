# FreeCAD Plus: Development roadmap

## Clean stable baseline — October 10, 2026

- [x] Verify official latest stable is 1.1.4; distinguish 26.3 RC1 prerelease.
- [x] Start clean branch from official 1.1.4 commit with its pinned submodules.
- [x] Preserve owner UI specifications/evidence and segregate old implementation documents.
- [x] Verify source equivalence and preserved-document integrity.
- [x] Publish the baseline branch and make it the fork's default working branch.
- [x] Record final status and remove temporary staging.

Source checkout, build, runtime validation and owner delivery are separate stages.
Original workbench source is retained.

## Light baseline verification — October 10, 2026

- [x] Confirm stable-release status and successful upstream release/CI workflows.
- [x] Recheck source equivalence and four pinned submodules.
- [x] Verify official Windows package checksum and executable signature.
- [x] Inventory runtime versions, shipped modules and all registered workbenches.
- [x] Check basic modeling, recompute, Undo/Redo, expressions, links and file exchange.
- [x] Check FCStd save/reopen and separate-process reopen/recompute.
- [x] Inspect exported model image; verify event processing and normal test exits.
- [ ] Resolve viewport capture artifacts and establish visible GUI acceptance.

[WORK_STATE](WORK_STATE.md#stable-baseline-inventory-and-light-runtime-check--october-10-2026)
owns inventory, provenance, results and limitations. Core checks pass using the
official binary matching this checkout. No local compilation or owner shortcut
delivery occurred; do not claim the display/jitter gate has passed.

## Subsequent work

Resolve the visible display gate before UI reimplementation. Owner review of
unconfirmed requirements remains open. A local source build remains a separate
stage when needed for development. Reimplementation is not started by this roadmap.

The [old roadmap](archive/pre-restart-docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) records archived
work only. Its checked milestones and outstanding tasks do not describe this source
branch or authorize restoring old code. This file is the only current roadmap.
