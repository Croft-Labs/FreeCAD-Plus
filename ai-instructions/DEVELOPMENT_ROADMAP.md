# FreeCAD Plus: Development roadmap

## Clean stable baseline — October 10, 2026

- [x] Verify official latest stable is 1.1.4; distinguish 26.3 RC1 prerelease.
- [x] Start clean branch from official 1.1.4 commit with its pinned submodules.
- [x] Preserve owner UI specifications/evidence and segregate old implementation documents.
- [x] Verify source equivalence and preserved-document integrity.
- [x] Publish the baseline branch and make it the fork's default working branch.
- [x] Record final status and remove temporary staging.

Source checkout, build, runtime validation and owner delivery are separate stages.
No baseline build or GUI acceptance is claimed. Original workbench source is retained.

## Subsequent work

Owner review of unconfirmed requirements remains open. A separately requested
baseline build and interaction check can establish behavior before specific approved
features are reimplemented. Reimplementation is not started by this roadmap.

The [old roadmap](archive/pre-restart-docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) records archived
work only. Its checked milestones and outstanding tasks do not describe this source
branch or authorize restoring old code. This file is the only current roadmap.
